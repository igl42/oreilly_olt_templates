* Step 1: Define the 'SequenceContainer' concept to constrain the 'addElement()' function
*         such that for sequence containers the 'push_back()' function is used and for
*         associative containers the 'insert()' function. The concept should pose the following
*         requirements on the given type:
*           - the type should be a regular class type;
*           - the type has a nested type 'value_type';
*           - the type has a nested type 'iterator';
*           - the type has a nested type 'const_iterator';
*           - the type has a member function 'size()', which result in something convertible to 'size_t';
*           - the type has a member function 'empty()', which results in 'bool';
*           - the type has a member function 'begin()', which results in 'iterator';
*           - the type has a member function 'end()', which results in 'iterator';
*           - the type has a member function 'cbegin()', which results in 'const_iterator';
*           - the type has a member function 'cend()', which results in 'const_iterator';
*           - the type has a member function 'push_back()';
*           - the const type has a member function 'begin()', which results in 'const_iterator';
*           - the const type has a member function 'end()', which results in 'const_iterator'.
*           - the type supports equality comparison.
*           - the type supports less-than comparison.
*
* Step 2: Define the type trait 'IsSequenceContainer', including the according variable template
